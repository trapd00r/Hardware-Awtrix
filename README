NAME
      Hardware::Awtrix - Perl interface to Awtrix

SYNOPSIS
      use Hardware::Awtrix {
        host     => $ENV{MQTT_HOST},
        user     => $ENV{MQTT_USER},,
        password => $ENV{MQTT_PASS},
        topic    => $ENV{AWTRIX_NOTIFY_TOPIC},
      };

      my %message = (
        text     => 'Hello world!',
        color    => '#ffff00',
        icon     => 1,
        rainbow  => 'true',
        duration => 15,
      );

      publish(\%message);

DESCRIPTION
    Simple module that allows you to send messages to your esp32-based
    awtrix device using mqtt.

    The topic would be somethins similar to "awtrix_d4924/notify".

    The icons need to be downloaded to your device, and then referenced by
    id. You can see those ids in the web interface of your flashed clock.

    Recommended to disable all the apps on the clock itself. This way, the
    clock will be blank until it receives a message.

EXPORTS
      publish

FUNCTIONS
  publish(\%message)
NOTES
    Would rather use the Net::MQTT::Simple module but I had zero luck
    getting it to work with my specific broker.

    Therefore, the mosquitto_pub command is used for now.

TODO
    Figure out all of the options that can be passed to the awtrix device.
